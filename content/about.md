My name is Sam Castle.
I am creating this blog mainly to write for my own sake and to organize my thoughts.
And because I enjoy tinkering with web sites.     
If others wish to read it, they are welcome.

Hopefully one day I will add some real information to this page,
so that I am less mysterious.

For now, you may contact me at <sam@samcastle.com> with questions or complaints.
