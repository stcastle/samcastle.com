# Intro

I recently led a one-hour classroom discussion on startups for my five-year reunion at Davidson College.
This post is a summary of the notes I used to plan the session, and the topics are as follows,

1. What is a startup?
2. How to create and pitch a startup idea
3. 5-minute Market Analysis
4. Myth or Not? Lies you will tell yourself about starting a business
5. Pros and Cons of being your own boss
6. Extra topics and handouts

Many of the ideas here were inspired by [Paul Graham's essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) and
Scott Galloway's book _The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google_.
I'll try to link to specific essays and excerpts when relevant.

# What is a startup?

Which of the following companies are startups:
Slack,
Instacart,
Uber,
Wikipedia,
Amazon,
AWS,
Davidson College,
your local barber shop,
Tesla,
Facebook
?

With many more examples,
I don't necessarily have a correct answer,
and I think it quickly becomes clear that we all have a vague notion of what a startup is,
but it's surprisingly tricky to pin down to classify specific companies.
Possible criteria include                                              
age of company,                              
need for external investment,
for-profit,
privately-held,
high growth, 
small number of employees,
small revenue,
novel problems,
or 
non-obvious success.
There's not a consistent agreement here,
and if you ask someone in Silicon Valley, New York, and Florida
about which of these criteria are essential for a startup,
you may get very different answers.

The point here is that startups take many shapes and sizes and there is no one "correct" recipe.
As far as when a company is a startup and when it isn't,
I tend to agree with
[Paul Graham's assertion that startup = growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html).
The defining characteristic of a startup,
in my opinion and according to Paul Graham,
is the goal of selling to a large market.
This shapes the behavior and output of the startup in defining ways
because rather than serving only a local or easily-satiable need,
startups need to make something lots of people want in a way that can reach and serve all those people.
The key is scale and it necessitates that startups be focused on growth.
I posit that this, whether explicitly defined or not,
is the viewpoint of startups in Silicon Valley culture,
and a very different meaning may be understood elsewhere.
