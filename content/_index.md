Welcome to my blog.
It's a work in progress.
I plan to write some posts on rare occasions,
mostly for myself.
See more about me on the [About page](/about/) and see my musings on the [blog](/post/).

I built this site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
and used the [Cupper theme](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme),
an accessibility-friendly Hugo theme.
I am deploying the site to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
